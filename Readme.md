Task Overview
The goal of this project is to build a simple HTML and CSS form that collects the following user data:

Form Fields:
First Name
Last Name
Username
Email
Phone Number
Password
Date of Birth
Nationality
Accept Terms and Conditions
Upload Profile Picture
Requirements:
Mobile Responsive: The form must be fully responsive on mobile devices.
Form Validation: Ensure all fields are validated using HTML and JavaScript.
Technologies Used
HTML - For structuring the form and page.
CSS - Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript - To handle form validation and logic.
Tips for Implementation
Tip 1: The form MUST be mobile-responsive. Ensure that all input fields and elements adjust properly on smaller screens.
Tip 2: Validate the form using HTML5 built-in validation (e.g., required fields, email format) and enhance it with JavaScript for additional custom checks (e.g., password strength, matching passwords).
